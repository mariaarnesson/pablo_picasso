        <h2>About Pablo Picasso</h2>

        <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 - 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, 
            sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France.
             One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement,
              the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, 
              and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.
               Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907),
                and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), 
            a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
    
    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age.
         According to his mother, his first words were "piz, piz", a shortening of l√°piz, the Spanish word for "pencil"</p>
   
    <h2>Style and technique</h2>
    <p>In his paintings, Picasso used colour as an expressive element,
         but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space.
         Picasso's early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, 
         but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials.
         Picasso painted mostly from imagination or memory.Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman</p>
